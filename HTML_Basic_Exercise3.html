    <h1>I STILL HAVE FAITH IN YOU SONGTEXT</h1>

    <p><i> I still have faith in you
        I see it now
        Through all these years that faith lives on
        Somehow
    <br>    
        There was a union
        Of heart and mind
        The likes of which are rare
        And, oh, so hard to find
    <br>
        Do I have it in me?
        I believe it is in there
        For I know I hear a bittersweet song
        In the memories we share
    <br>
        I still have faith in you
        And I will say
        I never really thought Iâ€²d feel this way
    <br>
        But I remind myself
        Of who we are
        How inconceivable it is to reach this far </i></p>
